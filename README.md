# File Compressor

## Description:
This is a proof-of-concept implementation for a file compressor for compressing files into a compact binary file. This uses the Huffman encoding technique across 256 byte values to compress the inputted files at
the binary level, reading it byte by byte in compression. It also stores the Huffman table in the compressed file with minimal space addition.
